Hello my name is Sumit....in this project i used Marvel API by registering in their website:- https://developer.marvel.com/signup ....

So the basic features inside this webside is present in Homepage, Superhero page and Favlist

     In Homepage :- a) Displayed a list of SuperHeros and also created search bar that will filter out the character based on search query.
                       Suppose I type “spi” in the search box, it should show “spider-man”. 

                    b) Each search result of the superhero  has a favourite button,clicking on which superhero is addded in "My favourite List"

                    c) On clicking any particular search result opens a new page with more information about the superhero.



     In Superhero page :- a) Shows information about the superhero like name, phot, bio, comics, series, stories.

     My favourite list :- a) Displays a list of favourite superheroes added
                          b) List persistency (means after restarting the browser the favourite list should not get deleted)
                          c) Delete button (to delete favourite superhero from favourite list)
